## Video Organization

The videos in this directory are used for:

- Hero sections
- Background videos
- Testimonial videos
- Educational content

## Video Best Practices

1. **Optimization**
    - Use appropriate compression (H.264/H.265 codec)
    - Keep file sizes under 5MB when possible
    - Provide multiple resolutions when needed

2. **Accessibility**
    - Always include captions or transcripts
    - Ensure videos have proper controls
    - Avoid auto-playing videos with sound

3. **Performance**
    - Use poster images for videos
    - Lazy load videos below the fold
    - Consider using video streaming for longer content

4. **Usage Guidelines**
    - Use the `VideoHero` component for hero sections
    - Provide fallback images for all videos
    - Set `muted`, `playsInline`, and `loop` attributes appropriately

## Video Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, kebab-case names (e.g., `personal-injury-consultation.mp4`)
- Include dimensions or quality in the filename for multiple versions (e.g., `hero-video-720p.mp4`)
- Use language prefixes for bilingual content (e.g., `en-testimonial.mp4`, `zh-testimonial.mp4`)

## Adding New Videos

1. Optimize for web use (compress, reduce file size)
